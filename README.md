# House Price Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the sales price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, using machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide an accurate model for predicting house prices based on a comprehensive dataset with 79 explanatory variables.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is provided by Kaggle and contains 79 explanatory variables describing various aspects of residential homes. The target variable is "SalePrice," which we aim to predict. The data is divided into a training set and a test set.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files, including `train.csv` (training data) and `test.csv` (testing data).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing and model training.
- `README.md`: This README file.
- `requirements.txt`: List of project dependencies.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step to ensure the data is suitable for model training. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In this section, we explore the dataset, analyze the distribution of features, and investigate relationships between variables and the target "SalePrice."

## Modeling

We build and train machine learning models to predict house prices. Different algorithms and techniques are explored, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and more.

## Evaluation

The performance of the models is evaluated using the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) metric. Cross-validation is employed to assess model performance.

## Submission

Once we have a well-performing model, we make predictions on the test set and prepare the submission file for the Kaggle competition.

## Dependencies

This project relies on several Python libraries, including but not limited to:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
